    *General Work flow:
    - First we login using the form in index.html and passing it through the loginServlet
    - Then we are validated using cookies in the loginSuccessfulServlet  which is in fact included in the loginServlet
    - In that page we can view the cart From the showCartServlet and all the additional features including adding
      items, removing items, checking out and even logging out is done through this page.
